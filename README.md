# HEL_IVA
Heldigris IVA mods

Dependencies: MOARDv and its dependencies.

Quick description of the files:

The files ending with "internal" are the IVA interior files
The files NOT ending with "internal" are the config files for the MASFlightComputer (Which is needed to run the DSKY and probably other functionality aswell.)

These files should overwrite the MOARDv Mods example crafts without the need to delete the files.
